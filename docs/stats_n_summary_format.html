Header Section</h1>
<p>The header section of a statistics file starts from the beginning of the file until the "Notes" section. It is comprised of some standard information:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Specifications,</div>
<div class="line">, Encryption, </div>
<div class="line">, , Scheme, &lt;scheme_name&gt;</div>
<div class="line">, , Security, &lt;security_name&gt;</div>

<div class="line">, , Encrypted op parameters (index), &lt;list_of_indices_for_each_encrypted_op_param&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The elements listed above will always appear in a header. Some extra elements adding human readable descriptions may appear interspersed throughout.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md171"></a>
Notes Section</h1>
<p>The "Notes" section follows the header and may contain important information regarding the benchmark performed, or it could be blank if no extra information is required. Some extra information may include whether validation was disabled during the execution of the benchmark, for example.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md172"></a>
Main Event Section</h1>
<p>During a benchmark run, Test Harness measures timings for every event that occurs during execution. Events are grouped by type because some types may occur more than once. While all events are measured, the focus of each supported workload is on the performance of a specific event. Unless otherwise specified the focus in a workload is centered on the "Operation" event type by default (corresponding to calls to the <code><a class="el" href="namespacehebench_1_1APIBridge.html#a3d07f6b56035cea3fad6fd7005b22de0" title="Performs the workload operation of the benchmark.">hebench::APIBridge::operate()</a></code> function ). However, the framework is designed such that workloads may indicate a main event type other than "Operation". The event type which is the focus of a workload is known as the <b>main event</b>.</p>
<p>The main event is workload specific and is part of the workload definition; thus, it cannot be changed. Test Harness takes care of properly executing the main event such that statistics can be collected correctly, such as performing requested number of warmup iterations in a latency test, or establishing a minimum execution time in offline category, etc.</p>
<p>Each event type is uniquely identified within the report by a numeric ID. The main event for the workload executed in the benchmark is indicated in the "Main event" section of the statistics and summary files. This section is a single line containing the ID for the main event, followed by the name of the event type.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Main event,&lt;event_type_id&gt;,&lt;event_name&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>In general, the name given to event types is used for informational purposes only and is inconsequential. Only the unique event type ID is important. Each event type corresponds to one of the main functions from the <a class="el" href="function_pipeline_chart.html">API Bridge function pipeline</a> .</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md173"></a>
Data Section</h1>
<p>The final section of a statistics or summary file is the table containing the data with information regarding the benchmark executed. This data is the result of the statistical computations based on all the events recorded in the benchmark report.</p>
<p>Test Harness measures both, wall time and CPU time for a benchmark.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wall time: real time elapsed from the start to the end of an event.</li>
<li>CPU time: accumulated time that each CPU spent in processing during an event.</li>
</ul>
<p>The statistics table contains a section for each: Wall time and CPU time.</p>
<p>The following information is collected for both Wall and CPU time.</p>
