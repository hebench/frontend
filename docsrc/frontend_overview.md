========================

[TOC]

##Description

The HEBench frontend consists of the components relevant to users running benchmarks, extending the test harness with their own benchmarks, and developers who wish to contribute new tests and workloads to the framework.

The main component of the frontend is the Test Harness. It is the main executable that benchmarks the performance of supported HE workloads implemented in backends. All HEBench users should become familiar with the Test Harness features and functionality.

##Components
The frontend is comprised of the following components:
 - @ref test_harness_overview : benchmarks solutions to supported HE workloads provided on backends which implement the API Bridge.
 - @ref report_compiler_overview : compiles reports generated by Test Harness, producing human readable summaries and in-depth statistics.
 - @ref tests_overview : list of all currently implemented tests with detailed description for each one.

##Tutorials

**NOTE**: Extending the Test Harness is an advanced topic. The primary usage for HEBench is expected to be the creation of backends and benchmarking them with the existing Test Harness.
